Source Files
------------
sim.c -- main driver of the simulation
fetch.c -- FETCH stage implementation (no changes needed or allowed)
issue.c -- ISSUE stage. Template needs to be completed with implementation
dispatch.c -- DISPATCH stage implementation (no changes needed or allowed)
exec.c -- ISSUE stage implementation (no changes needed or allowed)
write.c -- WRITEBACK stage. Template needs to be completed with implementation
display.c -- An additional stage invoked every cycle to collect statistics and display state information
utils.c -- Code for initialization and helper functions

Header Files
------------
global.h  --- Constants and struct definitions 
sim.h -- Yacsim-specific header file (do not change)

Simulator Object File
---------------------
yacsim.o 

Executable
----------
demo -- binary to show sample execution trace

Execute the demo as follows:
-----------------------------
./demo > output

This will create a trace of the execution in a text file called "output"
that you can browse using a normal text editor.

To compile and run your program:
--------------------------------
gcc *.c ./yacsim.o -lm -o runme

Execute the program using:
----------------------------
./runme

or

./runme > out   if you want the output in a file called "out".
You can edit "global.h" to change TRACE and DEBUG flags and parameters for the simulation.
